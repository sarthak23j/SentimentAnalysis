# Sentiment Analysis with Deep Learning and LLaMA 3

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements a sentiment analysis system using a fine-tuned LLaMA 3 model. It allows users to input text (manually or in batches) and receive sentiment classifications (positive/negative) with confidence weights. The application features a Tkinter-based GUI and a Flask backend for inference and data handling.

## âœ¨ Features

- Fine-tuned transformer model (LLaMA 3) for accurate sentiment classification
- Real-time sentiment prediction via Tkinter interface
- Batch processing of multiple texts
- Web scraping of reviews (Twitter) using Selenium
- Sentiment trend visualisation over time

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- LLaMA 3 (via HuggingFace or LLaMA.cpp)
- Tkinter (UI)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Selenium (for data collection)


## ðŸ“Š Results

- Achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall on multiple test sets.
- Effectively handles contextual sentiment, sarcasm, and longer texts.
- Lightweight and optimised for local deployment with quantised model.
